<h1>Hello,</h1>
<p>
my name is Noah Anderson. I was born in Tacoma, WA and raised in many
places around the world including Washington, Germany, Italy, and now Colorado.
I was inspired to be an actor in the 6th grade and did my first play in the 7th
grade. Since then I have performed in several plays and musicals, auditioned and
got into a performing arts high school as a major in Theatre, worked
professionally on stage and camera, achieved the critics choice of a main stage
performance at the State and National Conference levels, and have been accepted
into several Theatre/Acting programs across the nation. I aspire to act and
perform because not only do I believe that it can most definitely effect and
change the world, but it also makes me happy. Performing entails excitement,
adrenaline, experience and connection all of which I strive for in my every day
life. I believe that through my craft and artistry I can make a difference.
